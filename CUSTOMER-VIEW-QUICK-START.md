## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Statistics show 0 even though customer has orders:**
- Check if orders are linked to customer ID correctly
- Verify API route `/api/customers/{id}/stats` is working
- Check browser console for errors

### **Admin tools not working:**
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify you have `users.update` permission
- Check if you're logged in as admin

### **Recent orders not showing:**
- Check if orders exist for this customer
- Verify order user field matches customer ID
- Check API response in Network tab

### **"View All Orders" doesn't filter:**
- Check if link includes `?search={email}` parameter
- Verify orders page search functionality works
- Try manually filtering by email on orders page
