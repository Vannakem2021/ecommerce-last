# Error Messages Improvement - Clear Authorization Feedback

## Date: January 2025

---

## Problem Statement

**BEFORE**: Users seeing technical "NEXT_REDIRECT" error when accessing restricted pages  
**Issue**: Confusing, non-user-friendly error messages that don't explain what went wrong or what to do

---

## Solution Implemented

Completely revamped error handling to provide **clear, actionable, user-friendly messages** for authorization and permission errors.

---

## Changes Made

### **1. Enhanced Global Error Page** (`app/[locale]/error.tsx`)

#### **Before:**
```tsx
// Simple error display - showed raw error messages
<div className='p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md w-1/3 text-center'>
  <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold mb-4'>Error</h1>
  <p className='text-destructive'>{error.message}</p>  // ❌ Shows "NEXT_REDIRECT"
  <Button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</Button>
</div>
```

#### **After:**
```tsx
// Smart error detection with user-friendly messages
- Detects NEXT_REDIRECT errors → Auto-redirects with clear message
- Detects permission errors → Shows "Access Denied" with icon
- Shows development details only in dev mode
- Card-based UI with icons (ShieldX for permissions, AlertCircle for general)
- Contextual error titles and messages
```

---

### **2. Improved Unauthorized Page** (`app/[locale]/unauthorized/page.tsx`)

#### **Before:**
```
Title: "Access Denied"
Message: "You do not have the required permissions to access this resource."
```

#### **After:**
```
Title: "Access Denied" or "Sign In Required"
Primary Message: Clear explanation of what happened
Secondary Message: Why it happened and what to do
Attempted Path: Shows what URL was blocked (for debugging)
```

---

## New Error Message Types

### **Type 1: NEXT_REDIRECT Errors** (Technical)

**What It Is**: Internal Next.js redirect mechanism caught by error boundary

**User Sees**:
```
🟡 Redirecting...

You are being redirected. If this page persists, 
please try refreshing or going back to the home page.

Redirecting to home page in 2 seconds...
```

**Behavior**: Auto-redirects to home page after 2 seconds

---

### **Type 2: Permission/Authorization Errors**

**What It Is**: User lacks required role or permission

**User Sees**:
```
🛡️ Access Denied

Your current role does not have the required permissions 
to access this page or perform this action. If you need 
access, please contact your system administrator.

This typically means you need a higher role (Manager or 
Admin) to access this resource. Contact your administrator 
to request elevated permissions.

Attempted to access: /admin/users/create
```

**Actions**:
- ✅ Return Home button
- ✅ Go Back button
- ✅ Sign In with Different Account

---

### **Type 3: Authentication Required**

**What It Is**: User must sign in to access the page

**User Sees**:
```
🔐 Sign In Required
Error 401

You must be signed in to access this page. 
Please sign in with your account to continue.

Authentication is required to protect sensitive 
information and ensure secure access.
```

**Actions**:
- ✅ Sign In button (with callback to original page)
- ✅ Go Back button

---

### **Type 4: General Access Denied**

**What It Is**: Generic access restriction

**User Sees**:
```
🛡️ Access Denied
Error 403

Access to this page is restricted. You do not have 
the necessary permissions to view this content.

If you believe you should have access, please verify 
you are signed in with the correct account.
```

**Actions**:
- ✅ Return Home
- ✅ Go Back
- ✅ Sign In with Different Account

---

## Error Detection Logic

### **NEXT_REDIRECT Detection**
```typescript
const isRedirectError = error?.digest?.includes('NEXT_REDIRECT')
```
- Checks error digest for redirect marker
- Auto-redirects instead of showing error
- Prevents confusion from technical messages

### **Permission Error Detection**
```typescript
const isPermissionError = 
  error.message?.toLowerCase().includes('permission') ||
  error.message?.toLowerCase().includes('unauthorized') ||
  error.message?.toLowerCase().includes('insufficient') ||
  error.message?.toLowerCase().includes('access denied')
```
- Pattern matching on error message
- Shows appropriate permission-denied UI
- Uses ShieldX icon for visual clarity

---

## UI Improvements

### **Visual Indicators**

| Error Type | Icon | Color | Card Border |
|------------|------|-------|-------------|
| **NEXT_REDIRECT** | 🟡 AlertCircle | Yellow | Default |
| **Permission** | 🛡️ ShieldX | Red | Red border |
| **General Error** | ⚠️ AlertCircle | Yellow | Default |

### **Layout**
- ✅ Card-based design (consistent with app)
- ✅ Centered, responsive layout
- ✅ Maximum width constraint (max-w-md)
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Action buttons full-width

### **Information Display**
- ✅ **Primary message**: What happened (bold, larger text)
- ✅ **Secondary message**: Why and what to do (muted, smaller)
- ✅ **Attempted path**: Shows blocked URL (code-style, monospace)
- ✅ **Dev details**: Error message + digest (only in development)

---

## Development vs Production

### **Development Mode** 🛠️
- Shows full error messages
- Displays error digest
- Shows attempted path
- Console logging enabled

### **Production Mode** 🚀
- Generic user-friendly messages only
- No technical details exposed
- Security-conscious wording
- Clean, professional presentation

---

## Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Seller tries to create a user**

**Before**:
```
Error
NEXT_REDIRECT
```

**After**:
```
🛡️ Access Denied

Your current role does not have the required permissions 
to access this page or perform this action. If you need 
access, please contact your system administrator.

This typically means you need a higher role (Manager or 
Admin) to access this resource. Contact your administrator 
to request elevated permissions.

Attempted to access: /admin/users/create

[Return Home] [Go Back] [Sign In with Different Account]
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Unauthenticated user tries to view orders**

**Before**:
```
Error
NEXT_REDIRECT
```

**After**:
```
🔐 Sign In Required
Error 401

You must be signed in to access this page. 
Please sign in with your account to continue.

Authentication is required to protect sensitive 
information and ensure secure access.

[Sign In] [Go Back]
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Manager tries to access Settings**

**Before**:
```
Error
NEXT_REDIRECT
```

**After**:
```
🛡️ Access Denied

Your current role does not have the required permissions 
to access this page or perform this action. If you need 
access, please contact your system administrator.

This typically means you need a higher role (Manager or 
Admin) to access this resource. Contact your administrator 
to request elevated permissions.

Attempted to access: /admin/settings

[Return Home] [Go Back] [Sign In with Different Account]
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### **Error Boundary Enhancement**
```typescript
// Smart error type detection
const isRedirectError = error?.digest?.includes('NEXT_REDIRECT')
const isPermissionError = /* pattern matching */

// Conditional rendering
if (isRedirectError) {
  // Auto-redirect with countdown
} else if (isPermissionError) {
  // Show permission denied UI
} else {
  // Show general error UI
}
```

### **Auto-Redirect Logic**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isRedirectError) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      window.location.href = '/'
    }, 2000)
    return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  }
}, [isRedirectError])
```

## Testing Scenarios

### **Test as different roles:**

1. **Login as Seller**
   - Try accessing: `/admin/users` → Should see clear permission denied
   - Try accessing: `/admin/settings` → Should see clear permission denied
   - Try accessing: `/admin/categories/create` → Should see clear permission denied

2. **Login as Manager**
   - Try accessing: `/admin/users` → Should see clear permission denied
   - Try accessing: `/admin/settings` → Should see clear permission denied
   - Try accessing: `/admin/products/delete/[id]` → Should see clear permission denied

3. **Not logged in**
   - Try accessing: `/admin/orders` → Should see "Sign In Required"
   - Try accessing: `/account/orders` → Should see "Sign In Required"

4. **All roles**
   - Trigger any general error → Should see clear error message (not NEXT_REDIRECT)
   - Check development mode → Should see error details
   - Check production mode → Should see generic message only
