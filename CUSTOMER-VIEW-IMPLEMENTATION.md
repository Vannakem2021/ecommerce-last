## 📊 STATISTICS CALCULATION

### **How Statistics are Calculated:**

```typescript
// Total Orders: Count of all orders
const totalOrders = orders.length

// Total Spent: Sum of completed/paid orders only
const completedOrders = orders.filter(
  (order) => order.paymentStatus === 'paid' || 
             order.deliveryStatus === 'delivered'
)
const totalSpent = completedOrders.reduce(
  (sum, order) => sum + order.totalPrice, 0
)

// Average Order: Total spent divided by total orders
const averageOrder = totalOrders > 0 ? totalSpent / totalOrders : 0

// Last Order Date: Most recent order
const lastOrderDate = orders[0]?.createdAt || null
```
