You're dealing with a classic case of role-based user management where different types of users (e.g., Customer, Seller, Manager, Admin) have different data requirements and validation rules, but they all share a common identity model (e.g., email, password, etc.).

Here’s how to handle this cleanly and scalably:

✅ Approach: Use a Base User Model + Role-Specific Profiles

1. Common users table

This table holds shared/authentication-related fields:

CREATE TABLE users (
id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
role ENUM('customer', 'seller', 'manager', 'admin') NOT NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

2. Role-specific profile tables

For Customer (needs address, phone, etc.):

CREATE TABLE customer_profiles (
user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
address TEXT NOT NULL,
phone VARCHAR(20),
-- other fields specific to customer
);

For Seller (no address needed, maybe shop name):

CREATE TABLE seller_profiles (
user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
shop_name TEXT NOT NULL
);

For Manager (simple, maybe just a name):

CREATE TABLE manager_profiles (
user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
full_name TEXT
);

✅ Form Validation Logic

In your application layer, when a user registers:

Check their role

Then validate the inputs according to the requirements of that role

Save to users first, then insert into the appropriate profile table

✅ Benefits of this Design

Separation of concerns: keeps unrelated data out of the main user table

Flexible validation: each role can have its own validation logic

Scalable: easier to add new roles in the future

Secure: avoids exposing irrelevant fields to unintended users
