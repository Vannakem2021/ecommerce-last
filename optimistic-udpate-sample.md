*Root cause

Cache Management: No revalidatePath() calls in server actions
State Synchronization: Client state and server state can diverge
Optimistic Updates: Incomplete error handling for failed operations
Component Communication: No mechanism to sync state across different parts of the app
Impact on User Experience
"Only one product appears": This happens because the client-side filtering in FavoritesList removes items that aren't in the local state, even if they exist on the server
"Heart icons don't update": The product cards show stale state because the favorites hook doesn't refresh after server-side changes
Inconsistent behavior: Users see different states in different parts of the app
Technical Details
The current implementation has these architectural issues:
Server Actions lack proper cache invalidation
Client State doesn't properly sync with server state after mutations
Optimistic Updates can fail silently or leave inconsistent state
Cross-Component State isn't properly managed
The favorites functionality is implemented but has synchronization and caching issues that prevent it from working reliably.


*solution

Perfect 👍 — if you’re using Next.js Server Actions, the reason you need to refresh is because your favourites page is rendered from server-fetched data, and your UI isn’t re-rendering after the action runs.

There are two ways to fix this:

🔹 1. Use useOptimistic for Instant UI Updates (Best UX)

Next.js provides useOptimistic
 to update UI before waiting for the server response.

Example:

'use client'

import { useOptimistic } from 'react'
import { removeFavourite } from './actions'

interface Favourite {
  id: string
  product: { id: string; name: string }
}

export default function FavouritesList({ favourites }: { favourites: Favourite[] }) {
  const [optimisticFavs, removeOptimistic] = useOptimistic(
    favourites,
    (state: Favourite[], id: string) => state.filter((fav) => fav.id !== id)
  )

  async function handleRemove(id: string) {
    removeOptimistic(id) // update UI immediately
    await removeFavourite(id) // server action call
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {optimisticFavs.map((fav) => (
        <li key={fav.id}>
          {fav.product.name}
          <form action={() => handleRemove(fav.id)}>
            <button type="submit">Remove</button>
          </form>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}


Here:

optimisticFavs updates instantly

Server action (removeFavourite) still runs to persist changes

No page refresh needed

🔹 2. Use revalidatePath in Server Action (Force Re-fetch)

If you don’t want optimistic UI, you can just re-fetch data after the action:

// app/favourites/actions.ts
'use server'

import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'
import db from '@/lib/db'

export async function removeFavourite(id: string) {
  await db.favourite.delete({ where: { id } })
  revalidatePath('/favourites') // refreshes data for this page
}


Then in your UI:

<form action={() => removeFavourite(fav.id)}>
  <button type="submit">Remove</button>
</form>


This will cause Next.js to refetch favourites server-side and update the UI — no manual refresh.

✅ Recommendation

If you want snappy UX → use useOptimistic

If you’re okay with slight delay but always want fresh DB data → use revalidatePath
