# Order Invoice Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Order System
- **Order Model**: Complete order schema with all necessary fields (items, pricing, addresses, payment info)
- **Order Management**: Both customer-facing (`/account/orders`) and admin (`/admin/orders`) interfaces exist
- **Order Details**: Comprehensive order details pages with full order information display
- **Email System**: Existing email infrastructure using Resend for purchase receipts
- **Settings System**: Site configuration with company info, logo, contact details
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with consistent styling patterns
- **Admin Layout**: Fixed sidebar layout with proper navigation structure

### Key Findings
1. **No existing invoice functionality** - Clean slate for implementation
2. **Rich order data** - All necessary information available for invoices
3. **Established patterns** - Consistent UI/UX patterns to follow
4. **Email infrastructure** - Can leverage existing email system
5. **Settings integration** - Company information readily available
6. **Permission system** - RBAC system in place for admin features

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Invoice Infrastructure

#### 1.1 Invoice Data Model & Actions
- **No database changes needed** - Use existing order data
- Create invoice-specific server actions in `lib/actions/invoice.actions.ts`
- Add invoice number generation utility

#### 1.2 Invoice Component Development
- Create reusable `InvoiceDocument` component based on UI reference
- Implement print-optimized styling using Tailwind CSS
- Ensure responsive design for both screen and print media
- Follow existing component patterns and styling conventions

#### 1.3 PDF Generation Strategy
- **Browser-based approach**: Use `window.print()` with print-specific CSS
- No external PDF libraries needed - keeps dependencies minimal
- Print styles will hide navigation and optimize layout
- Users can save as PDF using browser's print dialog

### Phase 2: Customer-Facing Invoice Features

- Integrate invoice viewing capability
- Maintain existing layout and styling patterns

#### 2.3 Invoice Display Page

- Add download/print controls

### Phase 3: Admin Invoice Features

#### 3.1 Admin Order Management Enhancement
- Add invoice actions to admin order list (`/admin/orders`)
- Add invoice section to admin order details
- Ensure proper permission checks using existing RBAC system

#### 3.2 Admin Invoice Controls
- View invoice functionality for all orders
- Print/download capabilities for administrative purposes
- Bulk invoice operations consideration for future enhancement

### Phase 4: Additional Access Points

#### 4.1 Email Integration
- Add invoice attachment option to existing purchase receipt emails
- Leverage existing Resend email infrastructure
- Optional feature - can be enabled via settings

#### 4.2 Account Dashboard Integration
